          Hi there! As you know, my name is Sandhya. I love helping people gain
          access to quality resources and connecting with community. I first did
          it as an analyst, helping refugee serving organizations, organizations
          that serve youth experiencing homelessness, and health promoting
          organizations provide the best quality of service to the greatest
          number of people they could. Later, I helped people reach for their
          dreams of working in an English-speaking environment and connecting to
          people from different cultures as an English teacher.
        </p>

          Interestingly enough, it was through conversations with some of my
          students that I started thinking about web development. You see,
          throughout my professional experience, my favorite projects involved
          creating tangible tools. I had been thinking about how to expand on
          that when conversations about web development came up with my
          students. I realized it was the perfect skill to support my efforts in
          creating quality, accessible tools. So, I took a front-end development
          course with SheCodes to learn the basics and started bringing my ideas
          to life. As they say, the rest is history!
